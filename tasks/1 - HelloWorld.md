The Hello World example expects a window that looks like this:

    [Label]
    [Text input "World"]
    [Button "Quit"]

The Label should display the text "Hello ", then what is currently written in
the text input, followed by an exclamation mark.

The text input should default to the text "World".

Changing the text in the input should automatically update the text in the
label.

Activating the "Quit" button should end the program.

All three elements should be on top of each other with the same width.
